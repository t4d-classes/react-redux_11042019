Exercise

1. Create a new file named 'carToolStore.js'. In the file, create and export a new store with 'carToolReducer' which is exported from 'carToolReducers.js'.

2. Using the React-Redux Provider, pass the store into the component tree. We are using the hooks approach, not the connect API.

3. Implement the delete car button functionality.

4. Edit Car is partially implemented and does not currently work. Figure out the 2-3 bugs which exist, resolve them and ensure Edit Car is working correctly.

5. Implement the cancel edit car feature. When the cancel button is clicked, the row being edited should change to view row. After adding, saving and deleting a car, the row in edit mode (if any) should be switched to view mode.

6. Ensure it all works.
